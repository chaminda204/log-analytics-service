# üìä Log Analytics Service

Application for analyzing web server log files. Upload an HTTP log file and get analytics such
as:

- ‚úÖ Number of unique IP addresses
- ‚úÖ Most frequent IP addresses
- ‚úÖ Most visited URLs

The MVP implements only the happy path and does not include validations (e.g., file format or size checks), security
features, virus scanning, or error handling.

### Product backlog

- Error handling
- Validations
- Security

### Assumptions and comments
This exercise is intended to demonstrate coding skills, including a focus on:
- ‚úÖ Clean code principles
- ‚úÖ SOLID design
- ‚úÖ Testable and modular architecture

To keep the solution concise and focused on core functionality, non-functional requirements such as the following were intentionally out of scope for this MVP:
- ‚ùå Virus scanning or content-based security checks
- ‚ùå Authentication/authorization or input sanitization
- ‚ùå Robust global error handling (e.g., via @ControllerAdvice)
- ‚ùå File validations such as:
        Empty file uploads
        Oversized files
        Unsupported file extensions

These aspects would need to be addressed in a production-ready version.
